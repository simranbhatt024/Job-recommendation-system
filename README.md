Job Recommendation System

Business Analysis Project

📌 Project Overview

The Job Recommendation System is a business analysis–driven project designed to recommend relevant job opportunities to users based on their skills, experience, and preferences. The system aims to reduce job search time, improve candidate–job matching, and help organizations target suitable candidates more effectively.

This project focuses on problem understanding, requirement analysis, data-driven insights, and solution design, rather than only technical implementation.
